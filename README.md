# **Payment Exchange Platform**

This repository contains the code for the final project of the course ***Design of Web Services and Computer Networks***. A **PHP** based website to manage an electronic payment platform which allows the user to login, exchange money with other registered users, and check a log page with all his transactions. Everything is made **responsive** in order to adapt to every type of device.

Goal of this project is to demonstrate a comprehensive and deep knowledge of the basis of **HTML**, **Javascript**, **PHP**, and **CSS**, without the help of any library. In order to run locally the application, download the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) environment, and add all the files under the the **htdocs** folder as follows:

```
.
└── htdocs
    └── files
        ├── confermaPagamento.php
        ├── connectionDB.php
        ├── footer.php
        ├── header.php
        ├── ...
        ...
    └── pagamenti.sql
```
Make sure to upload the file ```pagamenti.sql``` in your [**phpMyAdmin**](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).

Once everything is settled, you will be able to navigate the website. Here some examples of what you'll see:
